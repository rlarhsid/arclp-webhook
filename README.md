# arclp-webhook
The worst Linkplay webhook utilty ever made (Highly inspired by https://github.com/burritosoftware/arcaea-linkplay-webhook)

## Warnings
This is my first project to make something that actually works, and is good enough to share to people. There probably will be many issues, tell me or fix them if you can.

## How to use
Simply download the files, and place them where you want. Configure the dotenv file, and you're good to go. Note that you'll need some python libraries. I was too lazy to make a requirements.txt, so just see the "linklog_v2.py" file and guess what you'll need lul

## Functions
This script sends almost most of the data that is printed from the linkplay server to Discord. It has a simple, and neat Discord Embed Message design. Also, there are some additional datas that could be sent to Discord, but I didn't implement them (Due to laziness). So, if you need, you could code the script, and send them too!
